            Overnight may be more your style, with one, two and three night cruises are available from Echuca-Moama.
            Enjoy the river from sunrise until sunset, this is truly a remarkable experience.
            Why not captain a boat yourself? To hire a houseboat all you need is a valid drivers license to navigate the
            river at your own pace.

            Eco-tourism cruises are also available from the Barmah, (20minute drive from Echuca-Moama) venturing through
            the Barmah Wetlands and the Narrows.
